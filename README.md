# Quote Fetcher

The QuoteFetcher extension is a Chrome extension that allows users to fetch, save, copy, share, and view daily quotes. The extension uses an external API (API Ninjas) to retrieve a random quote based on the selected category (such as Happiness, Inspirational, etc.). It provides users with the ability to:

  Fetch a new quote by selecting a category.

  Save the quote to local storage for future use.

  Copy the quote to the clipboard.

  Share the quote using the native share functionality (if supported).
